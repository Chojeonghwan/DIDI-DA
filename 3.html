    <h3>Javascript Specification</h3>

    <p>
    The ECMA-262 specification contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. 
    <br>It defines the language.
    <br>But being that formalized, 
    <br>it’s difficult to understand at first. 
    <br>So if you need the most trustworthy source of information about the language details,
    <br>the specification is the right place. But it’s not for everyday use.
    <br>A new specification version is released every year. Between these releases, 
    <br>the latest specification draft is at https://tc39.es/ecma262/.
    <br>To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are “almost standard” 
    <br>(so-called “stage 3”), see proposals at https://github.com/tc39/proposals.
    <br>Also, if you’re developing for the browser, then there are other specifications covered in the second part of the tutorial.
